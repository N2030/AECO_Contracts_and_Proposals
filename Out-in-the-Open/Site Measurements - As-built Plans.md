## Hourly Rates Relative to Workflow	

Over the years, OpeningDesign has developed a preferred and unique way of working.  Although our website's [about page](http://openingdesign.com/about/) provides more detail, in a nutshell, most of our projects are [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and are conducted [out-in-the-open](http://openingdesign.com/about/).

Simply put, this way of working allows OpeningDesign and our extended team of consultants, to be more efficient--ultimately keeping costs down and bringing more value to our clients.  Having said that, we understand some clients, for whatever reason, may have hesitations regarding this approach.

To address your potential concerns, if any, we would like to offer the following (3) workflow and fee options:

 * **Approach (A): A Fully Open Approach** where the construction documentation, location, and the names of the parties involved in this contract are known and are shared publicly.  All of OpeningDesign's (and their consultant's) newly created documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  That is, will be freely available to any party for future use, assuming the terms such as [Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and [ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) are honored.
 * **Approach (B): An Anonymous Open Approach** where all newly created documentation is shared publicly, however, the project location and the names of the direct or indirect clients, are kept anonymous.   Again, similar to approach (A), all of OpeningDesign's (and their consultant's) newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
 * **Approach &#40;C): The Traditional Approach** where all documentation, and clients involved, remains confidential and private.   Per industry norm, the Architect and the Architect’s consultants are deemed the authors and owners of their respective Instruments of Service, and they retain all common law and statutory rights, including copyright.
